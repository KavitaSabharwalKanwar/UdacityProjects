# Performance Bounceback Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
- SteamVR Unity Plugin - v2.0.1 
- Hardware used – Vive

My name is Kavita Kanwar and it took me around 25 hours to complete the project. I have created the project for Vive.

The initial 2 frames are dropping below 90 fps but there’s nothing that I could do about it. It’s something related to co routine delayed calls in SteamVR SDK. Would appreciate if the reviewer can help me understand how to correct that (I am guessing that rendering of few gameobjects in the scene is causing that) 

The best thing about the project was that there was a lot of learning involved. It was great to understand the various aspects of performance optimization.
